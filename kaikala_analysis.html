		<h1>1.9 Project Analysis</h1>
			<h3>Site Intent</h3>
			<p>In looking through the client’s website (<a href="www.getgamingorlando.com">www.getgamingorlando.com</a>) it is clear that the intent of the site’s redesign in general is to improve the company’s web presence, create professional branding which will in turn increase company revenues and profits.  The main problems with the current site that will need to be addressed are the site’s bland and difficult color schemes, user-unfriendly layout and its current lack of interactivity enticing visitors to do business with Get Gaming Orlando.</p>
			
			<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
			<p>On a local basis, Get Gaming Orlando has little competition.  There are a few shops, only 2 of which I could find that had any kind of Internet presence at all.  One had a complete website (<a href="www.orlandogamezone.com">www.orlandogamezone.com</a>) that had a better overall flow and aesthetics than Get Gaming, but content was still somewhat disorganized and it was not interactive.  The other main competitor had only a Facebook page and did not have a website that I was able to locate.  Based on this, a redesign with an easy to use UI, interactivity to leverage the power of the Internet and professional aesthetics would considerably increase Get Gaming’s visibility on the web and customer volume.  In the larger arena of the Internet Get Gaming has considerable competition both by businesses that offer similar services and by do-it-yourself instructional videos.  Large repair companies dominate the search analytics on www.alexa.com with 23.34% “Share of Voice” for search terms of “ps3 repair”.  Youtube ranks 3rd in the same search pertaining to the do-it-yourself market.</p>
			
			<h3>Targeted Audience</h3>
			<p>Users of the website will likely be young adult gamers and parents.  In both cases, time will be of the essence and an easy to navigate home page with easy to distinguish visual cues to links of importance such as store hours, services offered, pricing and/or coupons and sales and store location will be very important.  The ability to schedule an appointment or drop off time via the website would be of high interest to both parties.</p>
			<p>The young adult gamer will be more likely to attempt to access the website via mobile devices, so a dynamic website able to scale to those needs is crucial.  Busy working Moms and Dads are turning to the Internet for quick convenient solutions to daily problems, and getting gaming consoles repaired for their children although important to them will be a task they want to deal with as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>
