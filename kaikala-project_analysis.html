		<h1>Project Analysis - Spring Lake Elementary Website</h1>
			<h3>Site Intent</h3>
			<p>During review of the client <a href="http://teachercenter.scps.k12.fl.us/education/school/school.php?sectionid=43/">Spring Lake Elementary's</a> website, the intent of this site's redesign is to improve the usability and the overall aesthetics of the website.  the current website is cluttered and difficult to navigate.  A redesign is necessary to give the website the usability needed for students, parents and faculty to obtain and/or present the information they need pertaining to their education.</p>
			
			<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
			<p>This website is not a business website, and is part of a public school district.  However, there are 5 elementary schools within 2 miles of the location of Spring Lake Elementary.  Of the five, four have websites.  One of them is another public elementary school from the same district.  The other 3 are private schools. </p>

			<p>All of the private school websites appear to have been designed by professionals.  They are clean, organized, easy to navigate and have visual appeal utilizing styling and photos in a way that compliments the design.  Of the 5 schools I was unable to find a website for only one private school:  Alternative Choices in Education Academy. The other public school was Forest City Elementary and has a similar web address as Spring Lake, which is to be expected, as they are part of the same school district.  However the design, layout and overall navigation of this school’s website is much cleaner and easier to use. </p>

			<p>Based on this information, a redesign that focuses on an easy to use UI and a site that has much better visual appeal would provide current students and parents ease in finding information relevant to them as well as create an image for prospective student’s parents of a clean, organized, professional and efficient educational facility.</p>

			
			<h3>Targeted Audience</h3>
			<p>Users of the website likely are parents of students that attend the elementary as well as extended family of those students and parents of prospective students (those who are interested in moving to the area or are newly relocated to the area).  In all cases, speed and ease of finding information on events, activities and important information such as registration instructions and school supply list requirements is of utmost importance.  Parents are very busy between juggling work and family life and being able to easily access information they need to assist their children at school is more of a necessity than a luxury.   Providing a solid user experience that is also pleasing to the eye will make parents and faculty personnel’s daily life much easier.</p>
